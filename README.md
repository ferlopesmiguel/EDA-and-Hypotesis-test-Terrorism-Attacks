EDA and Hypothesis test â€“ Terrorism Attacks

Context
In recent years, the world has witnessed a worrying increase in the number of terrorist attacks in different regions. These attacks have caused devastation and loss of life, as well as leaving a lasting impact on affected communities. With the aim of better understanding this phenomenon and exploring possible patterns and trends, an exploratory analysis of data on terrorist attacks around the world was carried out.

The dataset used for this analysis covers a significant period of time (1970 - 2017) and includes detailed information about terrorist attacks, such as location, date, type of attack, number of victims, among others. Exploratory analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the patterns underlying terrorist attacks, as well as identify possible correlations and underlying causes.

Goal
Clean and analyze data through graphs and statistical information, find patterns and test hypotheses.
